GSWDirCare=<span class="warning">Warning:</span> When adding files to your site, it is important that you add them in the right place. For example, you will need to place files you wish to be visible on the Internet within public_html or a subdirectory of public_html. If you placed them in <cpanel print="$homedir">/ for example, no one will be able to view them.
GSWDirIndex=When someone views a directory in your public_html area, they will see the index page for that directory. When creating your index page, you should use one of the following names (the first one found will be shown if the visitor doesn&#39;t specify a page in the URL):

GSWFilesDesc=Your website is made up of a group of files and directories, much like the Documents folder on your home computer. In this case, though, everyone in the world can see some of your files. To give you an idea of how the directories and files work, we&#39;ll look at a view of the File Manager.
GSWFTPDesc1=You can use FTP to upload files to your site. To do this, you will need to create an FTP account. You can do this in the

For example, the text/html MIME type equates to .htm, .html, and .shtml extensions on most servers, and this tells your browser to interpret all files with those extensions as HTML files. You can alter or add new MIME types specifically for your site (note that you can not alter the system defined MIME type values). MIME types are often used to handle new technologies as they appear. When WAP technology first appeared no one had these extensions set up on their server. With MIME types, however, you could have set it up yourself and begun serving WAP pages immediately.

SAReqScore=required_score
SAScore=score
SAScoreDesc=Assign scores (the number of points for a hit) to a given test. Scores can be positive or negative real numbers or integers. "SYM-BOLIC_TEST_NAME" is the symbolic name used by SpamAssassin for that test; for example, &quot;FROM_ENDS_IN_NU&quot;. If only one valid score is listed, then that score is always used for a test. If four valid scores are listed, then the score that is used depends on how SpamAssassin is being used. The first score is used when both Bayes and network tests are disabled. The second score is used when Bayes is disabled, but network tests are enabled. The third score is used when Bayes is enabled and network tests are disabled. The fourth score is used when Bayes is enabled and net-work tests are enabled. Setting a rule&#39;s score to 0 will disable that rule from running.
SAWListFrom=whitelist_from
SAWListDesc=Used to specify addresses which send mail that is often tagged (incorrectly) as spam; it also helps if they are addresses of big companies with lots of lawyers. This way, if spammers impersonate them, they&#39;ll get into big trouble, so it doesn&#39;t provide a shortcut around SpamAssassin. Whitelist and blacklist addresses are now file-glob-style patterns, so friend@somewhere.com, *@isp.com, or *.domain.net will all work. Specifically, * and ? are allowed, but all other metacharacters are not. Regular expressions are not used for security reasons.

SSHDesc=SSH allows secure file transfer and remote logins over the internet.  Your connection via SSH is encrypted allowing the secure connection. In this section you can manage your SSH keys to allow automation when logging in via SSH.  Using public key authentication is an alternative to password authentication.

EmailAuthDesc=Email authentication is the effort to equip messages of the email transport system with enough verifiable information, so that recipients can recognize the nature of each incoming message automatically. Enabling email authentication will help fight the spread of spam.<br><br>Both of the methods below work to prevent forged mail from going in and out of your server. The great benefit of enabling these methods is to prevent mail from looking like it is coming from your domain(s). When enabled, these methods should reduce the amount of bounce messages or unwanted emails received when spammers "spoof" one or more of your email addresses. 
EmailSPFDesc=SPF will specify which machines are authorized to send email from your domain(s). This means that only mail sent through this server will appear as valid mail from your domain(s) when the SPF records are checked.
EmailDKDesc=DomainKeys is an e-mail authentication system that allows for incoming mail to be checked against the server it was sent from to verify that the mail has not been modified. This ensures that messages are actually coming from the listed sender and allows abusive messages to be tracked with more ease.
