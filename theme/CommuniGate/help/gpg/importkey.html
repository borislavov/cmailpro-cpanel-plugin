<h2>What is GnuPG?</h2>
<p>GnuPG (<span class="caps">GNU</span> Privacy Guard) is free encryption software that lets you generate a matching public and private key. These keys are useful for keeping files private during transfer.</p>
<h2>About public key encryption</h2>
<p>Public key encryption is a method of communicating using a matching pair of keys (one public, one private) to create a secret code. This ensures that anyone looking at messages sent from or received by your computer will be unable to read them without access to the private key.</p>
<p>A <strong>private key</strong> is a string of characters that a computer uses to encode or decode encrypted messages. Keeping this key secret is integral to protecting your confidential information.</p>
<p>A <strong>public key</strong> is a string of characters that a computer uses to encode or decode encrypted messages it receives. Typically, a public key will be placed on a server so you can access that server with encryption.</p>
