<h2>What is disk space usage?</h2>
<p>Disk space usage is the amount of actual disk space being used by directories in your account. See the <em>File Manager</em> to view individual file sizes.</p>
<p>Note that a file or directory’s disk space <em>usage</em> is not the same as its <em>size</em>.
Because of how computers store data, a file that has, for example, 20 bytes of data (i.e. its <em>size</em> is 20 bytes) might actually occupy 4,096 bytes on the disk (i.e. its <em>usage</em> would be 4,096 bytes).
The difference between an individual file’s size and its disk usage is no more than a few thousand bytes, but a large number of files can make the total disk space <em>usage</em> substantially greater than the sum of individual file <em>size</em>s.</p>
<p>Note also that this page’s directory tree and chart report only disk space usage in your account’s home directory (<code><cpanel print="$homedir"></code>).
There may be other parts of the system that contain substantial amounts of data for your account. See the <i>Disk Space Usage</i> figure in the main page’s <em>Stats</em> bar for your account’s total disk space usage.</p>
