<p><strong>What is a Default Address?</strong></p>
<p>A Default Address, or catch-all, is used to capture all mail sent to addresses that do not exist on your domain. This address can be very useful when you have complex email addresses. For example, if your email address is mike.jones@domain.com and someone sends a message to mik.ejones@domain.com, in most cases, you will never get this mail. However, if you have a default address set up, the mail will be sent to that address and the person who watches the default address account can notify mike.jones@domain.com. Please note that the default address must be an actual email account or a forwarder. </p>
<p><strong>Default Address  Tip</strong></p>
<p>As much of the mail that goes to addresses that do not exist could be spam. You can simply bounce all of this mail or delete it. To bounce the mail and notify the sender that the address does not exist, set your default address to <strong>:fail: no such address here</strong>. To discard the mail, set your default address to <strong>:blackhole:</strong>.</p>
