  <h2>Enable/disable SpamAssassin</h2>
<p>SpamAssassin™ is an automated email filtering system that attempts to identify spam emails, based on content, and discards them. The filter scores the emails using spam characteristics. For more information about SpamAssassin, you can visit its <a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">website</a>.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Click <em>Enable SpamAssassin</em> or <em>Disable SpamAssassin</em> to toggle between options.</li>

<h2>Auto-delete spam</h2>
<p>This filter allows you to automatically delete messages marked as spam by SpamAssassin.</p>
<p>1. Click the <em>Score</em> pull-down menu and click the appropriate score (higher scores are more conservative and lower scores are more liberal).</p>
<p>2. Click <em>Auto-Delete Spam</em>.</p>
<h2>Disable auto-delete spam</h2>

<h2>What is SpamBox?</h2>
<p>This feature allows emails indentified as spam to be delivered to a separate mail folder named “spam.” If you do not regularly check and empty this folder, it may cause you to exceed your email or file system quota, resulting in a failure to receive legitimate messages.</p>
<p>For this reason, we recommend that you sort and delete spam messages using your mail client, rather than SpamBox.</p>
<p>If you do enable SpamBox, you can easily use <span class="caps">IMAP</span> or Webmail to check it. If you wish to use POP3 to check the SpamBox, just add “/spam” (without the quotes) to the end of your POP3 login. (Example: user@example.com/spam) For example, you can use this method if you wish to check the SpamBox from your BlackBerry® device.</p>
<h2>Sorting spam with your email client</h2>
<p>This is the preferred method of sorting and deleting spam messages. With SpamBox disabled, you can configure SpamAssassin to mark your email with an identifying subject (such as +++SPAM+++), which can then be used to filter each message into an appropriate location.</p>
<p>To do this, you must directly edit the SpamAssassin configuration file on the server, if your web host allows this. Its location is: /home/example/.spamassassin/user_prefs (where “example” stands for your cPanel username). Within this file, you must add a line formatted like this:</p>
<p>rewrite_header Subject +++SPAM(SCORE)+++</p>
<p>This will cause the subject line of a message marked as spam with a score of 6 to begin with +++SPAM(6)+++</p>
<p>You can then use cPanel’s Account Level Filtering feature to reroute messages based on their spam scores, as you desire.</p>
