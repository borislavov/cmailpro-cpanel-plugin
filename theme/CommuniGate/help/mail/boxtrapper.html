<p>BoxTrapper is an email verification system used to prevent spam. It works by sending a verification message back to anyone who sends you an email message.</p>
<p>Once the sender replies to that verification message, his or her email address is added to the BoxTrapper whitelist. As a result, future email from that address is always accepted.</p>
