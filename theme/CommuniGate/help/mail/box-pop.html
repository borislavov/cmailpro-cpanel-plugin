<p><strong>What is BoxTrapper?</strong></p>
<p>BoxTrapper is an email verification system that is used to prevent spam. BoxTrapper sends a verification message back to anyone who sends you an email. Once they reply to that verification message, they are added to a whitelist and future mail messages are allowed from their email address. </p>
<p><strong>What is the Queue? </strong></p>
<p>The BoxTrapper queue holds all unverified messages. Here, you can delete unwanted messages, or deliver wanted messages while adding the sender(s) of the message(s) to your whitelist. If you are expecting mail and not receiving it, it's probably in your queue. </p>
<p><strong>What is a White List?</strong></p>
<p>A white list is a list of email addresses that are able to send email to you.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Black List?</strong></p>
<p>A white list is a list of email addresses that are not able to send email to you. Their messages will be rejected. </p>
<p><strong>What is a Ignore List?</strong></p>
<p>A white list is a list of email addresses that are not able to send email to you. However, instead of their messages being rejected, they are simply discarded without the sender's knowledge. </p>
<p><strong>What is the Confirmation Message? </strong></p>
<p>The confirmation message is sent to anyone who emails you that is not on your whitelist, blacklist or ignore list. This message tells them to reply to the confirmation message. It is however, generic and you may wish to add personal touches to it. </p>
<p><strong>What is the Log?</strong></p>
<p>The BoxTrapper log shows all messages that came into your account during a specific day. It then shows whether the mail was queued, delivered or discarded. </p>
