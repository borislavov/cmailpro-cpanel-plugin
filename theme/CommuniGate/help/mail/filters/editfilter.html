<h2>What is a filter?</h2>
<p>A filter is a tool that processes mail according to your preferences. For example, a filter can automatically discard spam or save mail from a specified sender to its own folder.</p>
<p>In cPanel, filters can be applied to all email for the domain (Account Level Filters), or to each individual account (User Level Filters).</p>
<h2>Create or edit a filter</h2>
<p>1. Enter a name for your new filter in the <em>Filter Name</em> box.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Remember to use a different name for every filter. Using the same name will cause filters to be overwritten</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Select the email characteristic that you want to use to filter mail.</p>
<p>3. Select the criterion (or <em>operator</em>) you want to use to filter mail.</p>
<p>4. In the text box, type the characters or keyword(s) you want to use to filter mail.</p>
<p>5. Click the <em>+</em> button to add the rule. You can add more than one rule.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Click the <em>-</em> button to delete a rule.</li>
</ul>
<p>6. Select the action you want to take with mail “caught” by the filter.</p>
<p>7. Click the <em>+</em> button to add the action. You can add more than one action.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Click the <em>-</em> button to delete an action.</li>
</ul>
<p>8. Click <em>Activate</em>.</p>
<h2>Filter rules and actions</h2>
<p>You can choose rules and actions from among several options. Our documentation includes a <a href="http://docs.cpanel.net/twiki/bin/view/AllDocumentation/CpanelDocs/FilterOptions" target="_blank">complete list of filter configuration options.</a></p>
<h2>About operators</h2>
<p>When you create a filter using several operators, it may be useful to note that cPanel will always process the &#8220;and&#8221; operator before the &#8220;or&#8221; operator. As a result, email filters will be processed as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>A or B and C</em> will be processed as <em>A or (B and C)</em>.</li>
	<li><em>A and B or C</em> will be processed as <em>(A and B) or C</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to create a filter such as <em>(A or B) and (C or D)</em>, you would have to create it like so:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>(A and C) or (A and D) or (B and C) or (B and D)</em>.</li>
</ul>
