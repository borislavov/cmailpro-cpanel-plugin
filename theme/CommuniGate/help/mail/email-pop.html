<p><strong>What is an Email Account?</strong></p>
<p>An Email Account is an account that allows you to send and receive electronic messages. Each email account has a specific login (user@domain.com) and password. Each account also has a quota which limits how much disk space the account can use. Setting a quota is a good idea as all email takes up space and email messages with attachments can take up a lot of space. This space is part of your overall disk space quota.<br /><b>Note:</b> Be sure to enable SMTP Authentication in your E-mail client or you may not be able to send mail. If your e-mail client has trouble using a @ sign in the login, you can use +, :, or % sign instead. </p>

<p><strong>Adding Email Accounts</strong></p>
<p>To add an email account, you will need to provide a login name, password and quota. Please note that you can add an email account for any subdomain, parked domain, or addon domain on your account by selecting that domain from the drop list. After you provide the required information, click on <strong>Create</strong> to create the account. </p>
