<p><strong>What is Email Filtering?</strong></p>
<p>Email Filtering will intercept messages that are sent based on characteristics of those messages. For example, if you wish for all messages about sales of your product to go to sales@yourdomain.com, you could set up a filter for any subject that contains &quot;product sales&quot; to the destination sales@domain.com. Alternately, if you wish to block all mail that is about vi*gra, you could filter for any subject that contains&quot;vi*gra&quot; to the destination <strong>Discard</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Note: This is not per mail account, it is for all of your mail accounts. Per mail account filtering is done in webmail or desktop mail applications. </strong></p>
