<p><strong>What is Webmail?</strong></p>
<p>Webmail is a type of application that allows you to check <strong></strong>your email from any computer that has web access. To check your mail, go to either the link listed on the page for port https://<cpanel print="$CPDATA{'DNS'}">:2096 or through http://<cpanel print="$CPDATA{'DNS'}">:2095 or use http://<cpanel print="$CPDATA{'DNS'}">/webmail. Port 2096 is recommended as it is a secure port which protects your passwords and other information.</p>

<p><strong>Checking your Mail from a Desktop Application</strong></p>
<p>To check your mail through a desktop application you will need to configure the application. Your mail server is most likely mail.<cpanel print="$CPDATA{'DNS'}">. You will need to use the full username (user@domain.com) and password when setting up your account in your desktop mail application. It is a good idea to check 'My Server Requires Authentication' as well as most mail servers require this option.</p>
