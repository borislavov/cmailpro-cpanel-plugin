  <h2>Import addresses or forwarders</h2>
<p>This feature allows you to use 2 types of files to create multiple email addresses or forwarders for your account simultaneously. You may use an Excel spreadsheet file (.xls) or a comma-separated values sheet (.csv) to import the data.</p>
<h2>What is a <span class="caps">CSV</span> file?</h2>
<p>A <span class="caps">CSV</span> file is a plain text file that has been given a .csv extension.</p>
<p>When using a <span class="caps">CSV</span> file, you will need to separate your email addresses and passwords consistently, using commas, periods, or any character of your choosing. These separators are known as delimiters and separate the pieces of information that will be imported for each account.</p>
<p>In addition, you should separate each account or forwarder you would like to create using a new row in the spreadsheet or a new line in a <span class="caps">CSV</span> file.</p>
<p>You may import the following information:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Email address usernames (example: user1). <br />
<strong>Note:</strong> You can, but are not required to, include the domain (example: @example.com).</li>
	<li>Passwords for email addresses.</li>
	<li>Email quotas (example: 10 stands for 10 Megabytes).</li>
</ul>
<p>A sample <span class="caps">CSV</span> file might contain:</p>
<p>user1@example.com, Password, 10<br />
user2@example.com, Password, 10<br />
user3@example.com, Password, 10</p>
<h2>Import email addresses/forwarders</h2>
<p>1. Select the appropriate import type.</p>
<p>2. Click <em>Browse</em> and select an .xls or .csv file on your computer.</p>
<p>3. If you are importing a <span class="caps">CSV</span> file, select a delimiter. If the first row of the file consists of headers, click the <em>Treat first row as column headers</em> checkbox.</p>
<p>3. Click <em>Next</em>.</p>
