<h2>What is the Getting Started Wizard?</h2>
<p>The Getting Started Wizard can help you learn more about web hosting. It can also help you set up features in cPanel.</p>
<h2>What is <span class="caps">SSH</span>?</h2>
<p><span class="caps">SSH</span> (secure shell) is a network protocol that lets you access files on your web server over the Internet using a command line interface (<span class="caps">CLI</span>).</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> <span class="caps">SSH</span> gives you direct access to the files on the server. Take care not to modify files in a way that will cause problems for your server.</p>
<p>Before you use <span class="caps">SSH</span>, you should create <em>keys</em> that let you connect to the server securely.</p>
<h2>About public key encryption</h2>
<p>Encryption is very important for keeping <span class="caps">SSH</span> communications private. Public key encryption is a method of communicating using a matching pair of keys (one public, one private) to create a secret code. This ensures that anyone looking at messages sent from or received by your computer will be unable to read them without access to the private key.</p>
<p>A <strong>private key</strong> is a string of characters that a computer uses to encode or decode encrypted messages. Keeping this key secret is integral to protecting your confidential information.</p>
<p>A <strong>public key</strong> is a string of characters that a computer uses to encode or decode encrypted messages it receives. Typically, a public key will be placed on a server so you can access that server with encryption.</p>
<h2>Generate a new <span class="caps">SSH</span> key</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Click <em>Generate a new Key</em>. You will be directed to a new page.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will create a challenge password when generating the new key, to add an extra layer of security.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve generated public and private keys, keep your private key safely guarded.</p>
<h2>Import an <span class="caps">SSH</span> key</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;ve already generated a key pair, you can install it using this screen.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Click <em>Import Key</em>. You will be directed to a new page.</li>
</ul>
