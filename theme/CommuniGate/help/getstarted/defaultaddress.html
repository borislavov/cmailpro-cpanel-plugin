<p><strong>Note:</strong> When piping to a program, you should enter a path relative to your home directory. If the script requires an interpreter such as perl or php, you should omit the &#8220;/usr/bin/perl&#8221; or &#8220;/usr/bin/php&#8221; portion. Make sure that your script is executable and has the appropriate hashbang at the top of the script. If you do not know how to add the hashbang, just make sure to name your script file with the correct extension and you will be prompted to have the hashbang added automatically.</p>
