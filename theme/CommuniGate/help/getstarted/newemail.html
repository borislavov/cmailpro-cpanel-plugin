<h2>What is the Getting Started Wizard?</h2>
<p>The Getting Started Wizard can help you learn more about web hosting. It can also help you set up features in cPanel.</p>
<h2>What is an email account?</h2>
<p>An email account allows you to send and receive electronic messages.  Each email account has a specific login (user@example.com) and a password.  Each account also has a quota which limits how much disk space the account can use.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to enable <span class="caps">SMTP</span> authentication in your email client, or you may not be able to send mail.</p>
<h2>Adding email accounts</h2>
<p>To add an email account, you will need to provide a login name in the <em>Email</em> field, a password in the 2 <em>Password</em> fields, and a quota.</p>
<p><strong>Login name:</strong> Please note that you can add an email account for a subdomain, parked domain, or addon domain on your account by selecting that domain from the drop-down list.</p>
<p><strong>Password:</strong> We recommend using a strong password for all email accounts, to prevent malicious users from gaining access to the accounts.  cPanel can help by generating a strong password for you &mdash; just click <em>Password Generator</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Quota:</strong> Setting a quota is a good idea, as all email takes up space, especially email with attachments.  This space will count against your overall disk space quota.</p>
<p>After you provide the required information, click <em>Create</em>.</p>
