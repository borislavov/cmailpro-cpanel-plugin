<h2>What is the Getting Started Wizard?</h2>
<p>The Getting Started Wizard can help you learn more about web hosting. It can also help you set up features in cPanel.</p>
<h2>What is <span class="caps">SSH</span>?</h2>
<p><span class="caps">SSH</span> (secure shell) is a network protocol that lets you access files on your web server over the Internet using a command line interface (<span class="caps">CLI</span>).</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> <span class="caps">SSH</span> gives you direct access to the files on the server. Take care not to modify files in a way that will cause problems for your server.</p>
<p>Before you use <span class="caps">SSH</span>, you should create keys that let you connect to the server securely.</p>
<h2>About public key encryption</h2>
<p>Encryption is very important for keeping <span class="caps">SSH</span> communications private. Public key encryption is a method of communicating using a matching pair of keys (one public, one private) to create a secret code. This ensures that anyone looking at messages sent from or received by your computer will be unable to read them without access to the private key.</p>
<p>A <strong>private key</strong> is a string of characters that a computer uses to encode or decode encrypted messages. Keeping this key secret is integral to protecting your confidential information.</p>
<p>A <strong>public key</strong> is a string of characters that a computer uses to encode or decode encrypted messages it receives. Typically, a public key will be placed on a server so you can access that server with encryption.</p>
<h2>Generate a new <span class="caps">SSH</span> key</h2>
<p>1. Enter a key name, key password, and password confirmation in the appropriate boxes.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <em>Strength</em> box will show you the strength of your password choice. If you cannot think of a strong password, click the <em>Password Generator</em> button for an appropriate option.</p>
<p>2. Click the <em>Key Type</em> pull-down menu and click the appropriate key type.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <span class="caps">RSA</span> and <span class="caps">DSA</span> are encryption algorithms. <span class="caps">DSA</span> provides faster key generation and signing, while <span class="caps">RSA</span> provides faster verification.</p>
<p>3. Click the <em>Key Size</em> pull-down menu and click the appropriate key size.</p>
<p>4. Click <em>Generate Key</em>.</p>
