<p><strong>Create a rewrite</strong></p>
<p>For Ruby to respond without visitors having to specify a port number, you will need to configure a rewrite. </p>
<ol>
<li>Click the  menu and select the appropriate application domain name.</li>
<li>If you wish to run the application from a specific page within your domain, type the page name you wish to use into the available text field. </li>
<li>Click <em>Save</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Ruby application port numbers increment automatically with every new application. This means that, if you are on a shared server, you will simply be assigned the next available port number.</p>
