<p>Ruby on Rails is a web application framework for Ruby, a programming language.</p>

<li>Select <em>Load on Boot?</em> to load the application whenever the server boots.</li>
<li>Enter the application path in the <em>Application Path</em> box.</li>
<li>Click the <em>Environment</em>  menu and select the appropriate application environment.</li>
<li>Click <em>Create</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Manage applications using the <em>Available Ruby on Rails Applications</em> table</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>To sort rows in the table, click a column header.</li>
  <li>To access an applicationâ€™s Rails server, click <em>URL</em> to the right of the appropriate application name.</li>
<li>To run or stop an application, click <em>Run</em> or <em>Stop</em> to the right of the appropriate application name.</li>
<li>To load an application on boot, click the <em>Load on Boot?</em> box to the right of the appropriate application name.</li>

<p><strong>What is an application rewrite?</strong></p>

<p>Because Ruby on Rails uses its own server, users visiting your website (and  your Ruby on Rails application) will need to be redirected to the appropriate port. To do this, you can create a URL rewrite.</p>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Ruby application port numbers increment automatically with every new application. This means that, if you are on a shared server, you will simply be assigned the next available port number.</p>
<p><strong>Create an application rewrite</strong></p>
<li>Click <em>Rewrite</em> to the right of the appropriate application name in the <em>Create a Rewrite</em> table. You will be directed to a new page.</li>
<li>To sort rows in the <em>Create a Rewrite </em>table, click a column header.</li>

<p><strong>Manage current rewrites using the <em>Current  Rewrites</em> table </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To sort rows in the table, click a column header.</li>
<li>To change an application path, complete the URL using box to the right of the appropriate application name.</li>
