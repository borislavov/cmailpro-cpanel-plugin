<h2>What is a leech?</h2>
<p>A leech is a visitor who uses another person’s login information to access a restricted area of a website.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> 4 is the recommended setting.</p>
<p>2. In the second box, enter a <span class="caps">URL</span> to redirect leech users to.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Use an <span class="caps">URL</span> outside the protected area to avoid an internal server error message.</p>
