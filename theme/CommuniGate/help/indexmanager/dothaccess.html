<p><strong>Indexing options</strong></p>
<li><strong>Default System Setting</strong> - This is the default setting for all directories. Indexing will behave according to the server's configuration.</li>
<li><strong>No Indexing</strong> - This will prevent visitors from seeing the directory’s  contents. Instead, they will be directed to the index file for the directory. If no index file exists, visitors will see a <em>403 Forbidden</em> error page.</li>
<li><strong>Standard Indexing  </strong>- The directory index appears in a text-only format. All files and folders will be shown by their names only.</li>
<li><strong>Fancying Indexing</strong> - Information about the files, such as the size and time last modified, appears. </li>
