<p><strong>What is the <em>Index Manager</em>?</strong></p>
<p>When accessing a directory (rather than a page) on your site, a visitor will typically see the index page for that directory. If no index page exists, the browser will display a list (or index) of the files in that directory. </p>
<p>The <em>Index Manager</em> allows you to control whether and how your site will display the list of files and folders within each directory.</p>
<p><strong>Navigate the <em>Index Manager</em></strong></p>
<p>The current directory is always displayed at the top of the list.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click a <strong>folder icon</strong> to  open a subdirectory and view its contents.</li>
<li>Click <em>Up One Level</em> to open the directory that contains the one you're currently viewing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Select a directory</strong></p>
<p>Click the <strong>name</strong> of the directory whose indexing style you wish to change.</p>
