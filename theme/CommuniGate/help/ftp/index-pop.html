<p><b>What is FTP?</b><br />
FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. It allows you to transfer files to and from the server that your web site is on. To transfer files, you will need a FTP client and a FTP account. The advantage of FTP over downloading files from a web site is that with FTP, you can transfer a whole directory of files at a time, rather than one by one.<br />
<br />

<b>Why would I use FTP?</b><br />
There are many reasons to use FTP. While it is not as secure as some other methods, such as SCP, it has advantages. For example: If you have a repository of multiple files or a directory that many people will want to download, you can set up anonymous FTP access so those files can be downloaded all at once instead of one at a time. FTP can also be used to upload multiple files at once to your site.<br /><br />

<b>Access Control</b><br />
Please be aware that the new user will have read/write access to the directory you choose and every directory below it. For example, if you choose to add the user john, and give the user access to <cpanel print="$homedir">/public_html/john directory, the user will be able to add, edit, rename and remove any file or directory in <cpanel print="$homedir">/public_html/john.<br /><br />
If you enter a single / in the directory box, the new FTP user will have access to the entire public_html directory and all directories under it. If you just want the new user to be able to access a sub-domain, just set the directory box to the same value as the sub-domain's root name, which is listed in parenthesis on the sub-domain section of this control panel.<br /><br />


<b>Accounts to note</b><br />
Anonymous accounts are used for Anonymous FTP access and cannot be deleted. Logaccess accounts are used to download your site's log files and also cannot be deleted. Your main FTP account has access to all files within your domain and also cannot be deleted.<br /><br />

			
<b>What is Anonymous FTP?</b><br />
Anonymous FTP allows anyone to access a specified directory without a username or password. This means that anyone can access the files in your anonymous directory. Your anonymous directory is public_ftp/.</p>
