<p><strong>What is FTP?</strong></p>
<p>FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. It allows you to transfer files to and from the server that your web site is on. To transfer files, you will need a FTP client and a FTP account. The advantage of FTP over downloading files from a web site is that with FTP, you can transfer a whole directory of files at a time, rather than one by one. </p>

<p><strong>What is a FTP Account?</strong></p>
<p>A FTP Account allows someone to login with a specific username and password using the FTP protocol. This user will be only able to transfer files to and from the directory you specify and any sub directories that it contains.</p>

<p><strong>Configuration</strong></p>
<p>You will want to ensure that your FTP accounts are given their own unique usernames. They should also have complex passwords because anyone who gains access to a FTP account will be able to upload files to and download files from your site. If you wish for a user to only be able to access their own directory within your site, make sure to enter a directory name in the <em>Directory:</em> field. If you do not enter a directory name, they will have access to your entire site! </p>
<p><em>TIP:</em> Set a quota for your FTP accounts. Their quota is how many megabytes they can transfer to and from your site. FTP transfers use up your bandwidth! </p>

<p><strong>How do I use a FTP Account?</strong></p>
<p>To use a FTP Account, you'll need a FTP Client. You can find one by using a search engine with the phrase &quot;ftp client&quot;. You'll then need to download and install the FTP Client. After you run the FTP client, you'll need to enter your domain name (ftp.yourdomain.com), the username of the FTP account, and the password for the FTP account. You should then be logged in and able to see a list of your files. Check the help in the FTP client for how to use the specific features of the FTP client. </p>
