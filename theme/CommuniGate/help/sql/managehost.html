<p><strong>What is MySQL?</strong></p>

<p>MySQL refers to a database management tool, as well as the type of database it manages. Such databases are used by applications like bulletin boards and retail shopping carts. </p>

<p><strong>What is the <em>Remote MySQL</em> feature?</strong></p>
<p>Databases in cPanel can be accessed remotely, by other web servers. This can be useful if you wish to allow applications such as shopping carts or guestbooks on your other servers to access the databases. </p>
<p>This screen allows you to give external hosts (or servers) access to your MySQL databases.</p>

<p><strong>Add an access host</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Enter an IP address or domain name in the <em>Host</em> box.<br /><strong>Note:</strong> You may enter a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or an IP address. You may also use % as a wildcard. For instance, to allow access from all IP addresses beginning with 208.77.188, you can enter 208.77.188.%. </li>
<li>Click <em>Add Host</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Delete an access host</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Click <em>X.</em> You will be directed to a new page.</li>
<li>Click <em>Yes</em> to permanently remove the remote host's access, or click <em>No</em> to cancel the removal.</li>
</ol>
