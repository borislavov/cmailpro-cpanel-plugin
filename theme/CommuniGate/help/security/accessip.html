<h1>Manage Access IPs</h1>

<h2>What are access IPs?</h2>

<p>Access IPs are IP addresses from which you can access your cPanel account without having to answer security questions. For example, if you often use cPanel at a work computer and a home computer, you can specify the IP addresses of both, to prevent having to answer security questions when you log in.</p>

<p>You can see the most recent IP address from which you accessed cPanel by looking at the cPanel <em>Home</em> screen, under <em>Stats</em>, next to <em>Last login from</em>.</p>

<h2>Add an access IP address</h2>

<p>To add an access IP:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <em>Access IP</em> fields, enter the IP address you wish to add.</li>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Note:</strong> You may use an asterisk (*) in the last octet. This asterisk is treated as a wildcard, meaning any IP address within the specified IP address block  may skip security questions when logging in.</li>
</ul>
<li>When you finish entering the IP address, click <em>Add</em>.</li>
</ol>
