<h1>Security Policy</h1>

<h2>What is a security policy?</h2>

<p>A security policy is a measure that a server owner takes to protect the server from attacks. cPanel now lets server owners protect the server by requiring cPanel users to answer security questions whenever they log into their accounts from an unfamiliar IP address.</p>

<h2>What is the purpose of creating security questions and answers?</h2>

<p>Answering security questions identifies you as the legitimate cPanel account owner when you log into your account from an unfamiliar IP address.</p>

<h2>What are access IPs?</h2>

<p>Access IPs are IP addresses from which you can access your cPanel account without having to answer security questions. For example, if you often use cPanel at a work computer and a home computer, you can specify the IP addresses of both, to prevent having to answer security questions when you log in.</p>

<p>You can see the most recent IP address from which you accessed cPanel by looking at the cPanel <em>Home</em> screen, under <em>Stats</em>, next to <em>Last login from</em>.</p>
