<p><strong>Advanced DNS Zone Editor</strong></p><p>The Advanced Zone Editor allows you greater control in the setting up DNS zone records.  Here you can configure your zone file with the specifications you desire, such as the TTL, IP address, and type of record (A, CNAME, or TXT) </p><p><strong>What is TTL?</strong></p><p>TTL stands for Time to Live and is a limit on the period of time or number of transmissions that a unit of data can experience before it should be discarded.  TTLs occur in the DNS, where they are set by an authoritative nameserver for a particular resource record.  You can set the TTL in seconds (e.g. 14400) to describe when you want the record to be discarded.</p><p><strong>Record types</strong></p><p>A record: An A, or “address record,” matches your domain name to an IP address.</p><p>CNAME record: A CNAME, or “canonical name” record, matches your domain name to an alias.  This is useful if you are running a service other than the web server, such as an FTP server, on a separate port.</p><p>MX record: An MX, or mail exchanger record, tells a client which server receives mail sent to a domain name.</p>
