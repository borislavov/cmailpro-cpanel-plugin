<p><strong>What is DNS?</strong></p>

<p>DNS (Domain Name System) is the component of the Internet which acts as a “phone book,” converting human-readable domain names (such as www.example.com) into computer-readable IP addresses (such as 208.77.188.166).</p>
<p><strong>What is the DNS zone editor?</strong></p>
<p>The DNS zone editor allows you to edit your website’s DNS zone file. This file resides on the server, and it tells other computers on the Internet how to reach your site.</p>

<p><strong>Types of zone file records</strong></p>

<p>The zone file contains several resource records. You can edit 2 types of records for your site using this screen:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A (Address)</strong> – matches your domain name to an IP address. </li>
  <li><strong>CNAME (Canonical Name)</strong> – matches your domain name to an alias.
    
    To edit your site’s zone files, select the correct domain from the Domain drop-down menu. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add an A Record</strong></p>

<p>To add an A Record type in your site’s domain name (mydomain.net) in the Name field and the IP address (xxx.xxx.xx.xx) in the Address field.  If you do not know your domain’s IP address click on “I need help finding an IP address” and enter in the domain.</p>
<p><strong>Add a CNAME Record</strong></p>
<p>To add a CNAME Record type in your site’s alias (mail.mydomain.net) into the Name field and the site’s main domain name into the CNAME field.</p>
