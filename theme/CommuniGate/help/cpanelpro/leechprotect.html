<p><strong>What is Leech Protection?</strong></p>
<p>Leech Protection watches for logins to protected areas of your site from different IP addresses. After the number of logins (in a 2 hour period) exceeds the maximum number specified, it can alert you by email, redirect users attempting to login, and / or disable the compromised login.</p>

<p><strong>Why should I use Leech Protection? </strong></p>
<p>This protection is valuable for protected directories on your site because it will prevent unauthorized usage in large quantities. For example: If you gave out the login information for a directory in your site where someone could download important information, and the password was leaked, hundreds of users could have access to that information. With Leech Protection, you can set a limit to the amount of logins to that protected directory, in order to prevent unauthorized logins.</p>
<p>Be Careful when setting the limit! Setting it too low may prevent authorized users from connecting and setting it too high may provide no adequate protection.</p>

<p><strong>Configuration</strong></p>
<p>Setting the <strong>Number of Logins....</strong> is very important. Make sure to set this to a number that accounts for dropped internet connections but keep it low enough to prevent unauthorized usage. Get feedback and test. </p>
<p>You can redirect everyone who connects after the limit has been reached. This feature can be used to send them to a page with a warning about abuse, a simple error page, or other location.</p>
<p>It is advisable to disable accounts that have been determined compromised so that you eliminate people from being redirected. It can put a burden on your account if lots of viewers are being redirected to your error or other page after leech protection has gone into effect. </p>
