<p><strong>What is the <em>Thumbnailer</em>?</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Thumbnailer</em> tool allows you to quickly change the resolution (size) of all images in a directory. Modifications occur on a percentage basis. (If you wish to scale images individually or based on number of pixels, you must use the <em>Image Scaler</em> tool.)</p>

<p><strong>Change the resolution (size) of images</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Enter a width percentage in the first box and height percentage in the second box.<br />
  <strong>Note:</strong> Deselect  <em>Keep Aspect Ratio</em>  if you wish to change the width and height percentages independently. </li>
<li>Click <em>Thumbnail Images</em> to change the image sizes.</li>
<li>Click <em>Reset Dimensions</em> to change image sizes back to the default.</li>
</ol>

<p>After resizing your images, cPanel places them in a "thumbnails" subdirectory within the current folder. The thumbnail images will be created with the prefix "tn_".</p>
