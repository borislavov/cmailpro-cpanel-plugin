<p><strong>What is the <em>Image Scaler</em>? </strong></p>
<p>The <em>Image Scaler</em> allows you to change the resolution (size) of a single image. You can choose to modify the image based on a pixel or percentage basis.</p>
<p><strong>Navigate the <em>Image Scaler</em> directory list</strong></p>
<p>The current directory is always displayed at the top of the list.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click a <strong>folder icon</strong> to  open a subdirectory and view its contents.</li>
  <li>Click <em>Up One Level</em> to open the directory that contains the one you're currently viewing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Select an image</strong></p>
<p>Click the <strong>name</strong> of the image you wish to scale.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Resizing an image multiple times may result in a loss of quality. We recommend retaining a copy of your old image when resizing, to ensure the image does not become distorted. </p>
