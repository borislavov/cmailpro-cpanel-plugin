<p><strong>What is a redirect?</strong></p>
<p>A redirect lets you send visitors who try to access one URL to another URL. cPanel allows you to set up either temporary or permanent redirects. </p>
<p>Redirects are useful when you change the URL of a page on your site. You can put up a redirect at the old URL to make sure your visitors are automatically sent to the new URL.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> You cannot edit a redirect using this screen. If you wish to modify a redirect, you will need to delete and then recreate it.</p>

<p><strong>Add a redirect</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Select the appropriate redirect type (permanent or temporary).</li>
<li> Select the  domain of the URL you wish to redirect.</li>
<li>Complete the URL  using the box to the right of the slash (/).</li>
<li>Enter the new URL in the <em>redirects to</em> box.</li>
<li>Select an option for <em>www redirection</em>:<br />
  When you select <em>Only redirect with www</em>, only users who type &quot;www.&quot; in front of the URL will be redirected. <br />
  When you select <em>Redirect with or without www</em>., you will redirect all users regardless of whether the &quot;www.&quot; prefix is included with the URL. <br />
  When you select <em>Do Not Redirect www</em>., users who type &quot;www.&quot; with the URL will not be redirected. </li><li>Select <em>Wild Card Redirect</em> to redirect all files within a directory to the same filename in the new directory.<br />
  <strong>Example:</strong> When wild card redirects are active, if example1.com redirects to example.com, then a visitor trying to access example1.com/pic.jpg will be redirected to example.com/pic.jpg.<br />
  <strong>Note:</strong> The wild card redirect option cannot be used to redirect your main domain to a different directory on your site.</li>
<li>Click  <em>Add</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Search redirects for keywords</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Enter the keywords in the <em>Search</em> box.</li>
<li>Click  <em>Go</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>You may sort the list of redirects by clicking a heading. The redirects will be sorted according to the attribute you clicked (for example, <em>Directory</em> or <em>Type</em>).</p>

<p><strong>Remove a redirect</strong></p>
<li>Click  <em>Remove</em> for the appropriate redirect.
