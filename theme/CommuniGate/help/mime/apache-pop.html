<p><strong>What is Apache?</strong></p>
<p>Apache is a program that receives requests from web browsers. It then responds by “serving” web pages to the browsers; for this reason, it’s called web server software.</p>
<p><strong>What is an Apache handler?</strong></p>
<p>Apache handlers control how your site’s Apache web server software manages certain file types and extensions. Apache comes configured to handle CGI scripts and server-parsed files. Their file extensions include: .cgi, .pl, .plx, .ppl, .perl, and .shtml.</p>

<p>You can configure Apache to handle a new file type with an existing handler by manually adding the handler and extension on this screen. For example, to have the server treat files with the extension .example as CGI files, you would type ”cgi-script” under <em>Handler</em> and “.example” under <em>Extension(s).</em></p>
<p><strong>Available handlers</strong></p>
<p>The following Apache handlers are available. They are  followed by a module name in parentheses. Please note that  the module in parentheses must be installed within Apache on the server:</p>
<p><b>default-handler:</b> Sends the file using Apache’s default handler for static content. (core)<br />
  <b>send-as-is:</b> Sends the file with HTTP headers as they are. (mod_asis)<br />
  <b>cgi-script:</b> Handles the file as a CGI script. (mod_cgi)<br />
  <b>imap-file:</b> Parses the file as an imagemap rule file; for more information, see <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/">Apache’s documentation</a>. (mod_imap)<br />
  <b>server-info:</b> Retrieves the server’s configuration information. (mod_info)<br />
  <b>server-parsed:</b> Parses the file for server-side includes. (mod_include)<br />
  <b>server-status:</b> Retrieves the server’s status report. (mod_status)<br />
  <b>type-map:</b> Parses the file as a type map file; for more information, see <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/">Apache’s documentation</a>. (mod_negotiation)</p>
  
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This interface does not allow you to create custom Apache handlers. </p>

<p><strong>Create an Apache handler</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Enter the action/application path in the <em>Handler</em> box.</li>
<li>Enter the extension(s) in the <em>Extension(s)</em> box. You can use spaces to separate multiple extensions.</li>
<li>Click <em>Add</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Remove user-defined Apache handlers</strong></p>
<p>You can remove Apache handlers you have defined. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The file extensions automatically handled by Apache cannot be removed. </p>
<ol>
<li>Click <em>X</em> to the right of the appropriate handler in the <em>User Defined Apache Handlers</em> chart. You will be directed to a new page.</li>
<li>Click <em>Yes</em> to remove the handler or click <em>No</em> to cancel the removal.</li>
