<p><strong>What is a MIME Type?</strong></p>
<p>MIME Types tell browsers how to handle specific file extensions. For example,
  the text/html MIME Types equates to .htm, .html, and .shtml extensions on most
  servers, telling your browser to interpret all files with those extensions
  as HTML files. You can alter or add new MIME Types specifically for your site
  (Note: You cannot alter the system defined MIME Types values). MIME Types are
  often used to handle new technologies as they appear.</p>
<p>A MIME Type is a an Internet Media Type that is sent to a client application
  so it can handle the file properly. Basically, this ensures that a web browser
  understands what to do with the files that are sent to it. </p>
<p>For example: If you wanted to host .wav files and have your site's visitors
  be able to access them, you could add the mime type <strong>audio/x-wav</strong> for <strong>.wav</strong> files. </p>
<p>Modifying a MIME type allows you to change the way a type of file is presented
  to a visitor's web browser. For example, you could wish to have all .music
  files be presented as wave files. To do so, you could add the mime type <strong>audio/x-wav</strong> for <strong>.music</strong> files.</p>

<p><strong>Adding MIME Types </strong></p>
<p>To add a MIME type, you will need to specify the file type in the <strong>MIME
    Type</strong> field and the file extension or extensions to be associated
    with this MIME Type in the <strong>Extension(s)</strong> field, then click
    on <strong>Add.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Removing MIME Types </strong></p>
<p>Any user added MIME types will appear in green. These can be removed. All
  other MIME types are System Types and cannot be removed.</p>
<p>To remove a MIME type make sure the checkbox next to it is checked, and select <strong>Delete
    Selected</strong> from the <strong>Actions...</strong> drop list. </p>
