<h2>What is <span class="caps">SSL</span>/<span class="caps">TLS</span>?</h2>
<p><span class="caps">TLS</span> (Transport Layer Security) is simply the more recent version of <span class="caps">SSL</span>. Both are cryptographic schemes that allow for secure interaction between a web browser and a web server.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SSL</span> is useful for websites that will use logins and credit card numbers, since information will be sent to and from your website over the Internet as encrypted data versus plain text. This makes it difficult for malicious users to intercept communications between visitors and your website.</p>
<h2>What is the <em><span class="caps">SSL</span>/<span class="caps">TLS</span> Manager</em>?</h2>
<p>This screen allows you to secure sensitive information on your site by generating and managing <span class="caps">SSL</span> certificates, signing requests, and keys.</p>
<h2>What is an <span class="caps">SSL</span> (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate (<span class="caps">CRT</span>)?</h2>
<p>An <span class="caps">SSL</span> certificate is an electronic document (using the filename extension .crt) which binds a public key to a website.</p>
<h2>What is a private key (<span class="caps">KEY</span>)?</h2>
<p>A private key is a string of characters that a computer uses to encode or decode encrypted messages it receives.</p>
<p>Encryption schemes use a matching pair of keys (one public, one private) to create a secret code so that anyone looking at messages sent from or received by your computer will be unable to determine the contents of those messages without access to the private key.</p>
<p>A private key is integral to protecting your confidential information and should be safeguarded appropriately.</p>
<h2>What is a certificate signing request (<span class="caps">CSR</span>)?</h2>
<p>A <span class="caps">CSR</span> is a request, which you send to a certificate authority, for an identity certificate.</p>
<p>cPanel can generate a <span class="caps">CSR</span> for you, but since authorities vary with regard to the information they require, you should check their requirements before applying for a certificate.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Adding a private key is the first step in setting up an <span class="caps">SSL</span> certificate for your site.</p>
<p>We highly recommended that you use <span class="caps">SSL</span> certificates if your visitors will be submitting sensitive information to your website.</p>
