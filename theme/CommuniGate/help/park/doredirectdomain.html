<h2>What is a parked domain?</h2>
<p>A parked domain is a second domain that points to your primary domain. When users attempt to access the parked domain, they will see your main site. For example, both http://www.cpanel.net and http://www.cpanel.com go to the same place, as cpanel.com is a parked domain for cpanel.net.</p>
