  <h2>Change headers and footers</h2>
<p>Headers and footers are located at the top and bottom of the cPanel interface and often serve as consistent links to commonly accessed sections of the interface.</p>
<p>1. Locate the image you wish to replace. To assist you in finding the correct image:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Red numbers appear in the header and footer of the page. When you click a number, the corresponding file will blink.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Likewise, each file has a clickable image number. When you click the number, the corresponding header or footer image will blink.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Click <em>Browse</em>.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The custom headers or footers must have the same filenames as the originals.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>You may click <em>Reset</em> to return a header or footer to its default.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Select the file you would like to use as an icon from your computer.</p>
<p>4. Click <em>Upload Images</em> at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You may click <em>Reset All Icons</em> to return to the default headers and footers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>You may click <em>Generate Sprites</em> if your image is not displayed properly. This will regenerate the cPanel file containing your image(s) and may fix the problem.</li>
</ul>
<h2>More about sprites</h2>
<p>Sprites allow you to conserve bandwidth and improve performance by reducing the number of requests to your web server. They do this by storing all of your buttons and icons in a single image. When you upload an image, the sprites should be generated automatically.</p>
<p>However, cPanel offers a <em>Generate Sprites</em> link in case the process encounters a problem. The link is intended as a failsafe and should be used if the changes you have made to the appearance of the cPanel interface do not take automatically.</p>
