<h2>Change an icon</h2>
<p>Icons are located on the main screen of the cPanel interface. They are used to highlight features for your users.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Remember:</strong> Use appropriate and clear icons to ensure that you and your cPanel users can easily navigate the interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>1. Click <em>Browse</em>.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The custom icons must have the same filenames as the originals.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>You may click <em>Reset</em> to return to the default icon.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Select the file you would like to use as an icon from your computer.</p>
<p>3. At the bottom of the screen, click <em>Upload Images</em>.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You may click <em>Reset All Icons</em> to return all icons to the default icons.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>You may click <em>Generate Sprites</em> if your icon is not displayed properly. This will regenerate the cPanel file containing your icon(s), and may fix the problem.</li>
</ul>
<h2>More about sprites</h2>
<p>Sprites allow you to conserve bandwidth and improve performance by reducing the number of requests to your web server. They do this by storing all of your buttons and icons in a single image. When you upload an image, the sprites should be generated automatically.</p>
<p>However, cPanel offers a <em>Generate Sprites</em> link in case the process encounters a problem. The link is intended as a fail-safe and should be used if the changes you have made to the appearance of the cPanel interface do not take automatically.</p>
