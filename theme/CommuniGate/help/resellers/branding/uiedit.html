<h2>Edit the user interface (UI)</h2>

<p>Take care to examine each picture and description to ensure that you are replacing the right files.</p>

</ul>
<p>2. Select the file you would like to use as an icon.</p>

<ul>
	<li>You may click <em>Reset All Icons</em> to return to the default interface appearance.</li>

<h2>More about sprites</h2>
<p>Sprites allow you to conserve bandwidth and improve performance by reducing the number of requests to your web server. They do this by storing all of your buttons and icons in a single image. When you upload an image, the sprites should be generated automatically.</p>
<p>However, cPanel offers a <em>Generate Sprites</em> link in case the process encounters a problem. The link is intended as a failsafe and should be used if the changes you have made to the appearance of the cPanel interface do not take automatically.</p>
