<p><strong>About public  key encryption</strong></p>
<p>Encryption is very important for keeping SSH communications private. Public key encryption is a method of communicating using a matching pair of keys (one public, one private) that create a secret code. This ensures that anyone looking at messages sent from or received by your computer will be unable to read them without access to the private key. </p>
<p>A <strong>private key</strong> is a string of characters that a computer uses to encode or decode encrypted messages. Keeping this key secret is integral to protecting your confidential information.</p>
<p>A <strong>public key</strong> is a string of characters that a computer uses to encode or decode encrypted messages it receives. Typically, a public key will be placed on a server so you can access that server with encryption.</p>
