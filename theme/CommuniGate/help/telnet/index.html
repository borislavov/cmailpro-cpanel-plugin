<p><strong>What is SSH?</strong></p>
<p>SSH (secure shell) is a network protocol that lets you  access files on your web server over the Internet using a command line interface (CLI).</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> SSH gives you direct access to the files on the server. Take care  not to modify  files in a way that will cause problems for your server.</p>
<p><strong>About public  key encryption</strong></p>
<p>Encryption is very important for keeping SSH communications private. Public key encryption is a method of communicating using a matching pair of keys (one public, one private) to create a secret code. This ensures that anyone looking at messages sent from or received by your computer will be unable to read them without access to the private key. </p>
<p>A <strong>private key</strong> is a string of characters that a computer uses to encode or decode encrypted messages. Keeping this key secret is integral to protecting your confidential information.</p>
<p>A <strong>public key</strong> is a string of characters that a computer uses to encode or decode encrypted messages it receives. Typically, a public key will be placed on a server so you can access that server with encryption.</p>
<p><strong>Manage SSH keys</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>To create, import, and manage SSH keys, click <em>Manage SSH Keys</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are SSH Term and Java Telnet Applet?</strong></p>
<p>These  options allow you to connect to the server using SSH, without downloading any software, using key or password authentication. These actions both require Java.</p>
<p><strong>Log in using SSH Term</strong></p>
<p>To use SSH Term, you must have a private key installed on your computer. To install one, click <em>Manage SSH Keys</em>.</p>
