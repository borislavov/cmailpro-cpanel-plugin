<p><strong>What is FrontPage&reg;?</strong></p>
<p>FrontPage® is a Microsoft® application that allows you to edit your site in a WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) format, rather than using HTML code.</p>
<p><strong>What are FrontPage Extensions?</strong></p>
<p> FrontPage Extensions  allow you to publish your site directly from the application, allowing you to skip the FTP process.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> FrontPage extensions are no longer supported by Microsoft. <strong>We do not recommend using FrontPage extensions.</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, installing or uninstalling FrontPage extensions will reset the password protect feature on all directories and will remove all .htaccess files, as well as clear any changes made to .htaccess files. </p>
<p><strong>Install, reinstall, uninstall, or clean up old FrontPage extensions</strong></p>
