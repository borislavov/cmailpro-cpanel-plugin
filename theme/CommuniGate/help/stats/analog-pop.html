<p><strong>What is Analog?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Analog produces a summary of your site traffic along with a monthly report of the visitors to your site. You can navigate through the report by clicking on the items next to <strong>Go To:</strong> below the <strong>General Summary</strong> heading.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Key Terms to Understand</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Request</strong> - This is each time someone asks to see any part of your site. To see your site, they will have to &quot;request&quot; a specific page or file.</p>
<p><strong>File</strong> - Any part of your site (an image, html page, pdf document, script, etc)</p>
<p><strong>Host</strong> - The individual computers that view your site. Each computer that views your site is treated as differently. Multiple users on one computer will be treated as one host.</p>
