<h2>View bandwidth statistics</h2>
<p>The bandwidth charts record the bandwidth for today, the past 7 days, and the past 12 months.</p>
<h2>What is bandwidth?</h2>
<p>Bandwidth is the amount of data transferred to and from a web server.</p>
<p>Every time a visitor views a file (whether it’s a web page, image, video, or audio file), that file has to be transferred to the visitor’s computer, which is referred to as traffic.</p>
<p>Bandwidth is the total size of all these files transferred to your visitors’ computers. It is important to keep track of bandwidth usage, as it is limited by web hosts.</p>
