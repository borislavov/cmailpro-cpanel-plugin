<p><strong>What is Webalizer?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Key Terms to Understand </strong></p>
<p><strong>Data </strong>- Data is the contents of the files in your site. Anytime someone views a file, data is transferred and it will count towards your bandwidth usage.</p>
<p><strong>Hit</strong> - (Also called a Request) This is each time someone asks to see any part of your site. To see your site, they will have to &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;request&quot; a specific page or file. This includes both requests that were successful and those that were not. </p>
<p><strong>Entry / Exit Page</strong> - First (Entry) and last (Exit) pages requested during each <em>Visit</em>.</p>
<p><strong>File</strong> - Any part of your site (an image, html page, pdf document, script, etc)</p>
<p><strong>KByte</strong> - A Kilobyte or KB. This is is equal to 1024 bytes. KBytes are used when referencing the amount of data that was transferred to visitors of your site. </p>
<p><strong>Page</strong> - The main file being requested to bring up a page of your site. The individual items that make up the page (graphics, media, includes, etc) do not count towards this count. By default, only pages with .htm, .html or .cgi extensions are counted. </p>
<p><strong>Referrer</strong> - A Referrer is the web site that linked to your page / file. It &quot;referred&quot; the visitor to your page / file. </p>

<p><strong>URL</strong> - Uniform Resources Locator. A web address. For Example: www.mydomain.com/index.html </p>
<p><strong>User Agent</strong> - Web Browser or other software used to visit your site. </p>
<p><strong>Visit</strong> - The first time someone views a page on your site, a visit is started. Any other pages viewed by that visitor will not be counted as a separate visit until the visit times out (usually after 30 minutes). The visit ends at this timeout point. </p>
