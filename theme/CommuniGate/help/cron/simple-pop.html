<strong>What is a cron job?</strong>
<p>A cron job allows you to set the interval at which a  server command or script is executed. This feature is helpful for running repetitive tasks automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Adding Cron Jobs </strong></p>
<p>Simply add the command you wish to automate (the full location of the script) and select how
   often to run it. Please note that <strong>Day(s)</strong> select specific days of the month
   while <strong>Weekday(s)</strong> select a specific day of the week.</p>
<p>The output of the command can be sent to an email address if specified.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> It is important to understand that the e-mail address you supply will have an
   e-mail message sent to it each time this cron job runs. If this cron job runs daily, hourly etc. you
   may start receiving an undesirable amount of e-mail messages. It is recommended you do not use your
   primary e-mail address for this, unless you like receiving lots of e-mail!</p>
