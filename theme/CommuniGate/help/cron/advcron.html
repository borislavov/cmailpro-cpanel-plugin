<p><strong>What is a cron job?</strong></p>
<p>A cron job allows you to set the interval at which a  server command or script is executed. This feature is helpful for running repetitive tasks automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Adding cron jobs </strong></p>
<p>Adding cron jobs in the advanced cron editor is just like adding them to the crontab from the command line.  Set the frequency of the cron by entering a number in each field (* means every) and add the path to the command that will be executed at that(those) time(s).</p>
<p>The output of the command can be sent to an email address if specified.</p>
